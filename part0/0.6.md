# 0.6 — New note in SPA

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant browser
  participant server

  Note right of browser: user types note and submits (onsubmit prevents default)
  browser->>browser: update local notes array and DOM
  browser->>server: POST /new_note_spa (application/json)
  server-->>browser: 201 Created
  Note right of browser: no redirect, page stays local UI already updated
```

Comments:
- SPA prevents default form submit, updates local state/DOM immediately, and sends JSON via XHR/fetch.
- The server responds with 201; no further full-page reloads occur.
